# Travel-Management-Website
Travel Agency Websites provide access to essential information such as hotel contact numbers, booking addresses, schedules, cancellations, and bookings, and much more. It is a very efficient and user-friendly system for the users to retrieve the information they seek without unnecessary delays or frustrations. 
ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is designed with the specific needs of a travel agency website kept in mind. To ensure the website's directory remains up-to-date, users will be empowered with the ability to add, delete, and modify existing travel records within the system. 

These functionalities enable users to curate and manage their travel information effectively. Within the travel management website, users will have the capability to search for specific travel records and access details on all available bookings. When conducting a search, users can locate specific travel records using various criteria, such as booking reference or destination. If no matching records are found, the system will provide a clear and user-friendly error message based on the user's input, ensuring a smooth user experience. 





PROJECT OBJECTIVES

1. User-Friendly Interface: Develop a travel agency system with an interactive and user-friendly interface. This system should cater to the needs of travellers, making it easy for them to store and retrieve their travel records seamlessly. 

2. Contact Record Storage: Enables users to store a wide range of travelrelated information, including bookings, itineraries, and travel documents. The system should accommodate various types of travel records to meet diverse user needs. 

3. Interactive Graphic User Interface: Implement an interactive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) that ensures a comfortable and straightforward experience for both novice and experienced travellers. 

4. Centralized Database: Store all travel-related data in a central database to ensure efficient retrieval, viewing, and updating of records. 

5. Data Redundancy Elimination: Ensure that any modifications made to a travel record from one entry point are reflected consistently across the entire system, reducing the risk of duplicate or conflicting information. 

6. Efficient Search Functionality: Incorporate effective search features, allowing users to locate travel records quickly. Additionally, provide options for updating and deleting records for enhanced usability.
